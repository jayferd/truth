# Truth
Truth is an extensible DSL for defining and enforcing truth in a datacenter.  You can think of it as a more flexible rackmonkey that has the power to enforce itself by generating DNS and DHCP configs.

## Status
Truth is very much a work in progress.  Things that are on the table to work on next include a user interface, puppet/chef integration (e.g. an API endpoint for `extlookup()` calls, and more work tuning the vision.  Any and all help would be appreciated :)

## Contributing
Fork the repo and send me a pull request, and I'll probably be more than happy to merge it in.
